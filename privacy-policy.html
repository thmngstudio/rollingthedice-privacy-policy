    <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom, we use Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) to request your consent for personalized ads in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). You can withdraw or modify your consent at any time via the app’s privacy settings or by reinstalling the app.</p>

    <p>This app is not intended for children under 13 years of age (or the applicable age in your region), and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>
